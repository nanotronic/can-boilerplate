# can-boilerplate

> Start your [CanJS v2.x](https://github.com/bitovi/canjs/) projects faster and easier.

## Getting Started

This plugin requires NodeJS `~0.8` and __currently only works on a Mac__.

This is the initial release, with an intent on listening to your feedback.

### I have plans to:
* create a scaffolder
* support Windows and \*nix
* avoid having to _install_ NodeJS, as I have done with Grunt

### How all of this helps you:
* Get started quickly with Development and Production environment "shell" files
* Avoid feeling overwhelmed with a folder structure that's simple and light
* Save time with compilers and optimizers that do not require the use of a command prompt

### It currently comes packed with:
* [CanJS](http://canjs.com/) + [can-compile](https://github.com/daffl/can-compile)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) + [3L](http://mateuszkocz.github.io/3l/)
* [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) + [Almond](https://github.com/jrburke/almond)
* js/css minifiers and gif/png/jpg/svg optimizers

...and:
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) (no need to install it)
